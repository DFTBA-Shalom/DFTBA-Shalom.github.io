						Tuberculosis is the world's
						<span class="red">deadliest</span> infectious disease.
					</h2>
					<p>
						A total of 1.6 million people died from tuberculosis (TB) in 2021, making it the most deadly infectious disease worldwide—ahead of both HIV/AIDS and COVID-19...<wbr><strong>even though it's curable.</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						While an estimated 74 million lives were saved through TB diagnosis and treatment between 2000 and 2021, these are prohibitively expensive to the point that <strong>many who need them can’t afford it.</strong>
					</p>
					<p>
						Roughly 3 in 5 patients with multidrug-resistant TB do not have access to proper testing to find out if their TB is a multidrug-resistant strain. As a result, over half of them end up receiving long, expensive treatments that won't even help.

					<h2>Enter <span class="red">Danaher</span>.</h2>
					<p>
						Danaher is a large U.S. corporation that owns many smaller biotech companies, including Cepheid. Cepheid designs and manufactures diagnostic tests. Their MTB/RIF GeneXpert test determines whether someone has tuberculosis and whether it is resistant to one antibiotic, and their MTB/XDR test determines if the infection is extensively drug-resistant or not, enabling effective treatment.

					</p>
					<p>
						GeneXpert tests give fast and accurate results without the need for a fully equipped laboratory, which theoretically makes them ideal for use in countries with limited healthcare infrastructure, where results could otherwise take days or weeks to arrive.
					</p>
					<p>
						Sounds great, right?

			<section id="twist" class="container container-home">
				<div class="wrapper">
					<h2><span class="red">Not</span> quite...</h2>
					<p>
						Danaher uses what many call a “printer-ink” business model when it comes to the GeneXpert system. While a printer is usually sold for a reasonable price, the ink is often extremely expensive with a high profit margin. Danaher prices GeneXpert tests in a similar way.
					</p>
					<p>
						The reusable machines used to process these tests are moderately priced, but the single-use Xpert cartridges are extremely expensive. After years of public pressure from health organizations, Danaher has agreed to reduce the price of their standard TB cartridges from $10 to $8 for low- and middle-income countries. While this is a step in the right direction, it is just the first step.

					<h2><span class="red">Profits</span> over People.</h2>
					<p>
						Xpert cartridges for extensively drug-resistant TB are still priced at $15, which is much higher than the production costs calculated as part of MSF-commissioned research. We do not have access to detailed production information from Danaher at this time, and we look forward to the transparency that will come with their pledged third party audit, but the bottom line is that we know it’s simply not affordable for the people who need them most.
					</p>
					<p>
						<strong>We call on Cepheid and Danaher to prioritize people’s lives over maximizing profits by extending their commitment and reducing the price for extensively drug-resistant cartridges in low- and middle-income countries.</strong>

The global fight against tuberculosis (TB) faces a critical year ahead. That is why I am pleased to invite you on behalf of the Stop TB Partnership, a United Nations-hosted entity based in Geneva, Switzerland, to mark World Tuberculosis (TB) Day on 24 March 2024.

This year, the Stop TB Partnership raises awareness of the critical funding gap of USD 9 billion still needed to combat TB. TB remains the world’s second-largest infectious disease and kills more than 4,100 people every day, among them 650 children. That means that every minute, three people lose their lives from TB.

Each year, on 24 March, we commemorate the day in 1882 when Dr. Robert Koch announced the discovery of the TB bacteria. World TB Day is an occasion to re-energize our battle and mobilize political and social commitment to further progress towards eliminating TB as a public health burden.

Last year the world turned a new page in the fight against TB, following the September 2023 UN High-Level Meeting (HLM) on TB. We recognize and commend the impressive global response, with 7.5 million people (out of the estimated 10.3 million) newly diagnosed with TB - the highest number of people with TB ever diagnosed and treated in a year. We want 2024 to be even better and on World TB Day we would like everybody to take this message one step further by saying what each of us is doing to help End TB by 2030.

It is an honor to invite ________ to join the global movement and light up a city landmark, building, or clock in RED on 24 March 2024, to bring attention to the devastating impact of TB.

The Stop TB Partnership launched the “Light Up for TB” campaign for the first time in 2017, and we have attracted broad participation from over 60 cities in previous campaigns.

Now more than ever, the world community must come together to end this terrible disease.

We hope that _________ will show your support by joining the initiative for World TB Day 2024 and Light Up for TB. Time is running out – we must invest in ending TB and saving lives.

Yours sincerely,
[YOUR NAME]`)
