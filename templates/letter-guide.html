				<br>
				<br>
				<p>Here's some instructions for help with sending your letter!</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<b>Write your letter.</b>
						<br>
						<ol type="a">
							<li>
								You can choose to write a formal business letter based
								off of
								one of our templates and print it, write a handwritten
								letter,
								or get creative with a card or drawing.
							</li>
							<li>We hope that Danaher will read at least some of our letters,
								but
								can’t be sure. However, we’d love for you to share what
								you
								write on social media! If you are, remember to take a
								picture
								before you seal your envelope in the next step.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li><b>Put your letter in an envelope.</b>
						<ol type="a">
							<li>
								You can usually buy envelopes at the post office or
								office
								supply store, but most grocery stores and drug stores
								will have
								options as well. Envelopes typically aren’t sold
								individually,
								so check to see if you have one at home if you don’t
								want to end
								up with a box.
							</li>
							<li>Neatly fold your letter and seal it in the envelope.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Address your envelope.</b>
						<ol type="a">
							<li>
								<p>To address your letter to Danaher’s board write this
									on the
									front of your envelope (the side without a flap)
									in the
									center:</p>
								<div class="block">
									<p>c/o Corporate Secretary</p>
									<p>Danaher Corporation</p>
									<p>2200 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W.</p>
									<p>Suite 800W</p>
									<p>Washington, D.C. 20037-1701</p>
									<p>USA</p>
								</div>

							</li>
							<li>
								<p>If you'd like to address it to an individual member
									of the
									board, here’s some important members you can
									pick from.
									Add your selection on top of the line “c/o
									Corporate
									Secretary” in the address above.</p>
								<ol type="i">
									<li><a href="https://investors.danaher.com/board-of-directors?item=7"
											target="_blank">Rainer
											Blair</a> President and CEO of
										Danaher,
										whose pay has more than doubled since
										2020, now
										at $20 million per year.</li>
									<li>The founders, <a
											href="https://investors.danaher.com/board-of-directors?item=19"
											target="_blank">Steven</a>
										and <a href="https://investors.danaher.com/board-of-directors?item=18"
											target="_blank">Mitchell</a>
										Rales</li>
									<li>
										Other members of the board: Dr. Pardis
										Sabeti
										(past Crash Course host), Dr. Jessica
										Mega,
										Professor Raymond Stevens, and Dr. Elias
										Zerhouni (former Gates Foundation
										fellow).

						<h4>Example Letter</h4>
						<img src="../img/Danaher_Letter_EX.png" alt="An example letter."
							width="100%" class="letter" id="example-letter">
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Optional: Add your return address.</b>
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Return addresses are not required for standard mail
								in the US. If you don’t want to use your
								address, feel free to omit it. We do recommend
								including a return address if you’re comfortable
								to make it seem more legitimate.</li>
							<li>
								<p>To add a return address, write it in the top left
									corner of
									the front of the envelope. Here’s the format for
									US
									addresses:</p>
								<div class="block">
									<p>Alexander Hamilton</p>
									<p>58 Partition Street</p>
									<p>New York, NY 10038</p>
									<br>
									<em>If you don’t know your zip code (10038 in
										this
										example), you can find it by googling
										the rest
										of your address.</em>
								</div>
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Add postage.</b>
						<ol type="a">
							<li>
								In the US, normal letter postage stamps (also called
								Forever
								Stamps) cost $0.66 right now. You can buy stamps at your
								local
								post office or <a
									href="https://store.usps.com/store/results/stamps/_/N-9y93lv?utm_medium=search&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=evergreenps&utm_content=e332_eese&gad=1"
									target="_blank">buy
									them online</a> from USPS. Stamps are also
								available at
								some grocery stores, gas stations, and pharmacies,
								usually at
								the register.
							</li>
							<li>A standard $0.66 forever stamp can mail up to one ounce, or
								about
								four sheets of paper plus an envelope. If you’re mailing
								more
								sheets or heavier paper, you may need additional
								postage. Ask
								for help at the Post Office counter.</li>
							<li>If you are mailing a letter from outside the US, you may
								need to buy
								an international stamp. Check your local postal service
								for
								details.</li>
							<li>Affix your stamp to the upper right corner of the front of
								the
								envelope.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Mail your letter!</b>
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Option 1: If you live in a house with a mailbox at the curb,
								you can
								just put your letter in your mailbox and raise the flag.
							</li>
							<li>Option 2: If you live in an apartment building or shared
								housing
								complex, there may be an outgoing mail slot in the
								mailbox area.
							</li>
							<li>Option 3: Go to your local post office. Most will have a
								letter slot
								or dropbox you can use without talking to anyone. You
								can also
								walk up to the counter and ask for help.</li>
							<li>Option 4: Find a local USPS collection box by searching for
								your
								address <a
									href="https://tools.usps.com/find-location.htm?locationType=collectionbox&address=10020&searchRadius=1&fdbid=1001900018&latitude=40.76109&longitude=-73.9796&"
									target="_blank">here</a>.
							</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Optional: Post your letter on social media and tag Danaher.</b>
						<ol type="a">
							<li>Use the tag #PeopleOverProfits or #XDRNext in your post!

						<p class="date">[Date]</p>
						<p>To the Board of Directors, Danaher Corporation,</p>
						<br>
						<p>As you know, tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most deadly infectious
							diseases
							in the world, killing 1.3 million people in 2022. Many people
							and
							organizations around the world have been working to help put an
							end to
							that horrifying statistic, and your tests are a crucial part of
							it. Your
							Xpert MTB/RIF tests allow people to quickly and accurately get
							tested
							for TB and rifampin resistance which is a crucial step in
							enabling
							people working in health care to treat this curable disease, but
							providing reasonable prices for these tests is just the first
							step.</p>
						<br>
						<p>In 2022, around 410,000 people developed a form of drug-resistant TB,
							but
							only about two fifths of them were diagnosed correctly and put
							on
							appropriate treatment. Together we have the ability to change
							that. Your
							Xpert MTB/XDR cartridges can diagnose resistance to an amazing
							amount of
							tuberculosis drugs, which would allow people to be quickly and
							safely
							treated for some of the most dangerous forms of TB without
							unnecessary
							exposure to toxic and unsafe treatments. These tests can do an
							amazing
							amount of good for the world, but when it’s possible to make a
							fair and
							reasonable profit at $5, selling them for $15–three times that
							price–prevents them from having that impact.</p>
						<br>
						<p>While I eagerly anticipate the release of transparent information
							about the
							cost to produce MTB/RIF cartridges (your baseline tests), and
							greatly
							appreciate the steps you’ve taken towards more equitable
							testing,
							charging people in low- to middle-income countries $15 for
							life-saving
							diagnostics, like Xpert MTB/XDR cartridges, is not the correct
							path
							forward to helping reduce the toll of this curable disease. Your
							amazing
							tests only have the capacity to do good when they’re accessible
							to those
							who need them, and charging 1.5 times the median weekly wage in
							countries like Sierra Leone is not accessible. Around 3,600
							people are
							dying of TB every day, and lower MTB/XDR cartridge prices will
							facilitate the fight to bring this number down.</p>
						<br>
						<p>I look forward to working with you as we help to bring an end to the
							terrible impact tuberculosis and drug-resistant tuberculosis
							have on
							people living outside of high-income countries.</p>
						<br>
						<p>Sincerely,</p>

					<h3>Option 2</h3>
					<div id="option-2">
						<p class="date">[Date]</p>
						<p>To the Board of Directors, Danaher
							Corporation:</p>
						<br>
						<p>I’d like to begin this letter by expressing my deep appreciation and
							joy at
							the recent change to the pricing of Cepheid’s GeneXpert MTB/RIF
							Ultra
							test cartridge. Your commitment to selling this essential
							tuberculosis
							test at-cost to low and middle income countries around the world
							who
							have a heavy tuberculosis burden is a great step in the global
							fight
							against TB. The fight to end TB is far from over, but this is a
							big step
							forward in allowing patients to have access to the healthcare
							they need.
							I greatly appreciate the action you have taken in response to
							the
							TimeFor5 campaign, and hope that we can continue the
							conversation on how
							best to serve people and communities with TB worldwide.</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							I’d also like to commend your decision to increase transparency
							by
							allowing an independent company to review the pricing. Having
							clear and
							transparent costs will help make future agreements that can
							sustainably
							increase healthcare access. Your decisions will undoubtedly save
							millions of lives, and leave a positive mark on humanity. This
							decision
							to reduce the price of your tests is a cause of celebration for
							all.
							While we can and must do more, it is important to celebrate the
							steps we
							take to better the world, and your decision here has been a
							welcome move
							forward in that area. Thank you for listening to the concerns of
							many
							health organizations as well as the public and for showing your
							commitment to putting people over profits, in this area.</p>
						<br>
						<p>I hope together we can continue taking steps towards expanding access
							to
							diagnostics, such as lowering the price of Xpert MTB/XDR
							cartridges.
							Without continuing to expand access to your tests, people in
							need of
							life saving treatment will still be unable to access fast and
							accurate
							diagnostics. If those living in low- and middle-income countries
							cannot
							be tested for resistance, not only will more people continue to
							die of a
							completely curable disease, but resistant strains will continue
							to
							spread without any tests to help recognize and stop them.
							Together,
							let’s make TB something no one ever needs to worry about,
							regardless of
							wealth.</p>
						<br>
						<p>With best regards,</p>
