                Update: Johnson & Johnson commit to global non-enforcement of secondary patents
            </h1>
            <p class="post-date">September 30, 2023</p>
            <p>
                TBfighters around the world are thrilled at the <a
                    href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-confirms-intent-not-to-enforce-patents-for-sirturo-bedaquiline-for-the-treatment-of-multidrug-resistant-tuberculosis-in-134-low-and-middle-income-countries">news</a>
                that Johnson & Johnson will not enforce secondary patents for SIRTURO® (bedaquiline) in 134 low- and
                middle-income countries. This builds upon their agreement with the Stop TB Partnership/Global Drug
                Facility (GDF), which allowed for generic bedaquiline in 44 countries. Johnson & Johnson’s announcement
                means people with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) will be able to access a more affordable
                bedaquiline-containing treatment regimen regardless of their country’s eligibility or willingness to
                procure drugs through the GDF.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ending secondary patent enforcement will expand access to generic bedaquiline for countries such as
                South Africa, Ukraine, and Belarus, all of whom have a high-burden of TB but were excluded from the
                agreement with the GDF, meaning that until now they faced the continuation of high prices for
                bedaquiline. This represents a deep commitment to global health from J&J. This change of approach will
                save many lives, and allow more to avoid life-changing treatment complications, and we are truly
                thankful.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are very glad to have played a part in this change, building upon and amplifying years of work from
                TB advocates and organizations, such as <a href="https://msfaccess.org/msf-calls-commitment-pharma-corporation-jj-not-enforce-extended-patents-lifesaving-tb-drug-main">MSF (Doctors Without Borders)</a>,
				<a href="https://www.pih.org/article/pih-urges-further-steps-ensure-tb-drugs-available-all">Partners in Health</a>, the <a href="https://www.stoptb.org/news/stop-tbs-global-drug-facility-announces-historic-price-reductions-to-55-bedaquiline-life-saving">Stop TB
                Partnership</a>, the <a href="https://www.treatmentactiongroup.org/">Treatment Action Group</a>, the <a href="https://www.compcom.co.za/">South African Competition Commission</a>, who launched an
                investigation into J&J’s bedaquiline pricing, and all those involved in the recent UN High Level Meeting
                on Tuberculosis, including <a href="https://unitaid.org/">UNITAID</a>. We look forward to working in partnership for further progress.
                Together, we can end TB.
